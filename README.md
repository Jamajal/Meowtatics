This is a simple and fun project which I create and render 
some contacts cards of cats using React. I got the idea 
in the freeCampCode React course which I strongly recommend. 
I also build a simple backend crud using sqlite to store the card 
information, but the frontend and backend aren't integrated yet, 
for the reason that I don't know how that works yet rs.
